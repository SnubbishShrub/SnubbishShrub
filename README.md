- 👋 Hi, I’m @SnubbishShrub
- 👀 I’m interested in the videogaming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning, uh, everything. Very much a beginner.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on, uh, games, I guess? Although, I'm much more useful in the music department than coding.
- 📫 How to reach me: that's a secret! You'll never find me!!! Actually, you'll probably be able to pick out my username in a couple places. It's not very common.
